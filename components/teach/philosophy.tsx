          I believe in the power of learning through teaching. When we teach others, we not only share our knowledge 
          but also gain deeper insights into the subject matter. My approach to teaching focuses on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hands-on learning with practical examples</li>
          <li>Creating an inclusive and supportive environment</li>
          <li>Encouraging questions and critical thinking</li>
          <li>Building confidence through guided practice</li>
          <li>Adapting teaching methods to different learning styles</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>
